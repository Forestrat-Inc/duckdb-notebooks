### How to Use Prompts

**In Claude Desktop**:
1. The prompts appear automatically in your conversation
2. Simply ask in natural language: *"Give me a daily market summary for LSE yesterday"*
3. Claude will map your request to the appropriate prompt and execute it

**Direct MCP Call**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "params": {
    "name": "daily_market_summary",
    "arguments": {
      "date": "2025-01-15",
      "exchange": "LSE",
      "top_n": 15
    }
  }
}
```
