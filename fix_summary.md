# DuckDB S3 Connectivity & Jupyter Widgets Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. S3 Connectivity Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Error**: `Referenced column "size" not found in FROM clause!`

**Root Cause**: The `test_s3_connection` method in `utils/database.py` was trying to select a `size` column that doesn't exist when reading CSV files.

**Fix Applied**: Modified the SQL query in `test_s3_connection()` to:
- Remove the non-existent `size` column
- Use `COUNT(*) as record_count` instead
- Add `GROUP BY filename` to get counts per file
- Add `SAMPLE_SIZE=100` for faster testing
- Improve logging to show file details

### 2. Jupyter Widgets Error ‚ö†Ô∏è ADDRESSED
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ipywidgetsKernel')`

**Root Cause**: JupyterLab widgets extension issues

**Solutions Provided**:
1. **Cleaned and rebuilt JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab clean --all
   jupyter lab build
   ```

2. **Created alternative visualization approach** (`test_s3_connection.py`):
   - Uses matplotlib instead of Plotly widgets
   - Provides static plots that don't require widget rendering
   - Safe fallback for visualization issues

## Files Modified

1. **`utils/database.py`** - Fixed S3 connection test query
2. **`test_s3_connection.py`** - Created widget-free test script

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run the standalone test
```bash
python test_s3_connection.py
```

### Option 2: Fix notebooks manually
Add this to the top of your notebook cells:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.ioff()  # Turn off interactive mode

# Function to safely show plots
def safe_plot_show(fig, title=""):
    try:
        fig.show()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Widget rendering issue: {e}")
        # Use matplotlib as fallback
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.show()
```

### Option 3: Restart everything
1. Restart your Jupyter kernel
2. Clear all outputs
3. Run cells one by one

## Environment Setup Issues

If you're still having import issues:

1. **Check your virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   which python
   pip list | grep duckdb
   ```

2. **Install packages in the correct environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install duckdb pandas boto3 matplotlib python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Test imports**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import duckdb; print('DuckDB version:', duckdb.__version__)"
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ S3 connectivity should now work
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è For Jupyter widgets: Use matplotlib as fallback or restart kernel
3. üîß If still having environment issues, reinstall packages in the correct virtual environment

## Tips for Future

- Always use `COUNT(*)` instead of undefined columns when testing file access
- Have matplotlib as a backup for Plotly widget issues  
- Keep virtual environments clean and properly activated
